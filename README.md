Hello, 
Few weeks ago I started to study front-end. It's my first pages, my progress for 05/27 are styles, i try to improve CSS for my index page. I have to connect: fonts (size, weight, family), normalize.css, to check all colors on page, to make check paddings/ margins. I'll be glad for any comments/ assistance from your side. 
Thanks in advance.
